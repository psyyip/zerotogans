<h1>ZerotoGANS Project - COVID-19 X-Ray Detection</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
In this course project, I pick a COVID-19 Detection X-Ray Dataset and apply the concepts I learned in the course to train deep learning classification models end-to-end with PyTorch, experimenting with different hyperparameters & metrics. A project report is also created in the form a blog post to summarizing my results & findings.

<h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
Purpose of this project is to read the lung X-Ray images to tell if the lungs belong to COVID-19, bacterial, viral pneumonia patients or normal persons.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
Following the new Coronavirus(COVID-19) outbreak, data scientists are looking for patterns and methods to speed up testing and diagnostics. This dataset consists of X-ray(PA-CXR) images of COVID-19,bacterial and viral pneumonia patients and Normal people.

The dataset has three directories- TrainData,ValData and NonAugmentedTrain.

TrainData - 2083 images of shape (300,400,1) of Normal(901),COVID-19(60+60),Bacterial Pneumonia(650), Viral Pneumonia(412)
ValData - 988 images of variable shapes of Normal(450),COVID-19(9),ViralPneumonia(205),Bacterial Pneumonia(324)
Non Augmented Data - Same Data as TrainData but not augmented
